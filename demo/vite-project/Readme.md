🛠 Setup & Run Instructions
Prerequisites:
Node.js (v16+ recommended)

npm or yarn


🔍 Features
✅ Add new employees

✅ Edit existing employee info

First Name

Department

Role

💡 Reflection
✅ Challenges Faced:
Managing filter states alongside search and dropdown filters without conflict.

Aligning components like FilterForm and Header using regular CSS with flex layout.

Avoiding filter logic duplication across states.

✅ What I’d Improve with More Time:
Add pagination to manage large employee lists.

Store employee data in localStorage or backend (currently in-memory).

Add form validation for email format and required fields.

Make it mobile responsive with collapsible filter drawer.

Add sorting (A–Z / Z–A).
